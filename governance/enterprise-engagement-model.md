# Enterprise Engagement Model: Pre-Migration Strategic Framework

## Executive Summary: Pre-Migration Service Delivery Architecture

This document outlines the enterprise engagement model for SAP content risk assessment and remediation services. It defines how specialized content expertise integrates with enterprise governance, risk management, and service delivery frameworks during pre-migration planning phases.

The engagement model emphasizes strategic pre-migration assessment over reactive post-migration remediation, enabling organizations to make informed decisions before committing to irreversible migration investments.
