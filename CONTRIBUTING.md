# Contributing to the SAP Content Risk Playbook

Thank you for your interest in the SAP Content Risk Playbook. This is a **curated, single-maintainer repository** managed by PythonMate to ensure consistency, accuracy, and enterprise-grade quality.

## Contribution Policy

**This repository does not accept external contributions** via pull requests, issues, or forks for the following reasons:

### 1. Consistency & Accuracy
Content risk assessment requires precise architectural understanding and field-validated experience. Crowdsourced edits risk introducing inaccuracies that could mislead enterprise decision-makers.

### 2. Legal & Liability Considerations
This playbook is designed to be safely distributed to auditors, regulators, and legal teams. Maintaining single-source control ensures no operational procedures or client-specific information are accidentally introduced.

### 3. Enterprise Trust
Organizations share this documentation with Global System Integrators and audit firms. Unvetted contributions could undermine the document's credibility in high-stakes environments.

## Alternative: The 7-Minute Integrity Scan

If you are looking for **executable tooling** rather than documentation, see:

**Repository**: [pythonmate/pythonmate-7-minute-integrity-scan](https://github.com/pythonmate/pythonmate-7-minute-integrity-scan)

The scan is open-source (read-only diagnostic), while this playbook explains what scan results mean and why they matter.
